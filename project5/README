## High-level approach: 
We have a SimulatorSocket class which handles creating a socket and sending and 
receiving messages. We have a LoggingMixin class to manage logs for debugging. 
Our Server class is what implements the Raft protocol. It has all of the fields 
mentioned in the paper, along with some additional fields that we added to handle 
additional things such as pending requests during leader switches. In the main 
loop, we first check if we need to handle any messages that were not responded 
to because the leader was unknown at the time. Next, we send fails for any get 
requests that have timed out. Then, we retry AppendEntry RPCs to any replicas 
that have timed out. We also send a heartbeat if we are the leader and the 
heartbeat timeout has passed. We have a function apply_committed() which 
commits multiple entries to the state machine if the commit index is greater 
than the index that was last applied. 

As messages are received, we pass them to a dispatch() function which handles 
them accordingly. However, we first transition to the follower state if the 
term is stale and reset any timeouts. We use an enum to represent the three 
possible states that a server can be in. send() ensures that any message sent 
has the four required fields. send_redirect(), send_ok(), and send_fail() 
handle replies to the message source, which includes the client. 
send_request_vote(), handle_request_vote(), and handle_received_vote() are the 
main functions that handle the voting process in accordance with the Raft 
protocol. send_append_entries(), handle_append_entries(), and 
handle_append_entries_resp() are the main functions that handle communication 
between the leader and its followers regarding AppendEntries RPCs. handle_put() 
handles both put and get requests from the client.

## Challenges:
One challenge we faced was that we were sending too many messages, which caused 
some of the tests to fail. We believe that the main issue was during the 
election process, where the leader was unknown, so we would send fails to the 
client, which would keep hammering the servers with retries until a leader was 
elected. We resolved this issue by adding messages received during this time to 
a fail_or_redirect array to be handled later. We also motified the test script 
so that we could run the tests with a flag that the script to ignore any "too 
many messages" error so that we could first ensure that our Raft logic was 
correct. 

Another challenge that we faced was responding incorrectly to outstanding client 
requests. Originally, when a server was transitioning out of the leader state, 
any outstanding client requests were answered incorrectly because the client was 
expecting a response from the previous leader. We resolved this by making sure 
to respond to any outstanding requests before switching out of the leader state. 

A third challenge was that we were originally not handling the part of Raft that 
says that "only log entries from the leader's current term are committed by 
counting replicas" and how entries from previous terms are indirectly committed 
once the leader has committed an entry from its term. Because we missed this 
detail, our log was not entirely correct. However, once we added logic to handle 
this case, the tests passed. 

## Testing:
We built a debugging infrasture that logs messages at key points throughout our 
program so that we could walkthrough what was happening. Examples of some things 
we logged are a server's previous and new state and term upon transitioning and 
what entries were being committed. Even more helpful is that a logs get generated 
per server, so they are very readable. 

We also modified the test script to add additional stats and to allow us to run 
the script to bypass checks such as "too many messages" so that we could focus 
on ensuring that we were implementing Raft correctly. 

## Contributions:
Kimberly: created the SimulatorSocket class to handle socket connection and 
sending/receiving messages, created initial implmentation that handled the 
election process, executing and responding to client requests, and AppendEntries 
RPCs/heartbeats between the leader and its followers

Tristan: created the debugging infrastructure/modified the test script, revamped 
the initial implementation and added the missing Raft details, which included the 
logic for correctly appending log entries, efficiently responding to client requests 
during the election process, handling uncommitted entries during leader changes, 
and retrying AppendEntries RPCs for replicas that have not replied

We also pair-programmed at one point and utilized PRs to review and give feedback 
on each other's work.
