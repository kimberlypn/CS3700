This program was written in Python.

First, the program stores the arguments passed by the client. Next, the 
program connects to the server using a TCP socket or an encrypted SSL socket, 
depending on whether a -s flag was specified, with the stored arguments. The 
program then sends the initial HELLO message to the server. The program parses 
and solves the returned STATUS messages until a message without "STATUS" is 
received, at which point the program parses the BYE message and returns the 
secret key. The program validates the format of each message received by the 
server and returns an error if the format is incorrect. The program also 
returns an error if the number of arguments passed is invalid or if the 
program fails to connect to the server.

This was my first time writing a full program in Python, so one challenge was 
just learning how to code in Python. Other challenges that I had were creating 
the Makefile and writing regex expressions to validate the messages received.

I tested my code by using print statements. For example, I printed the 
client's arguments to make sure that I was grabbing the correct values from 
sys_args. I also printed the messages received from the server and the answers 
that my program was returning to check that everything was correct. 
Additionally, I tested functions using the interactive console.
